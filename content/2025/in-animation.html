{{< recap id="01" title="Thundercats Roar" image="IMG_2537.PNG" link="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/details/ae4a45639d4c347a9697d6bc0b25416c/thundercats-roar-exodus-part-one" >}}
Cheeky, tongue-in-cheek take on the original Thundercats lore. It’s chibi, fun and lighthearted, with the Thundercats themselves portrayed as
self-absorbed, yet ultimately endearing characters.

Tygra is the only one doing the invisible label, invisible because they're too self-absorbed to care.

Snarf is a  deus-ex-machina swiss-army machine that sometimes works to your advantage. Or not. Don't force a cat.

Mumrah has to hide himself to commit acts of kindness and overall care about things.

Every screenshot is a delight. I've been watching it slowly so they're always there.

Best episodes? Thunderslobs: Tygra is upset at carrying the load of cleaniness without ever being recognized, ends up cleaing Mumrah's lair, Mumrah recognizes his efforts and they find they have a lot in common on how they organize things, and the only way to justify this bond is to pretend Tygra has been mind-controlled to submit, in a wink-wink cleaning fetish.

Or Snarf’s Day Off: both snarf and mumrah separately hide as commoners to participate on an yearly craft fair/craft market, and fight on a competition, while maintaining their disguise.

Do your jumps to find it, [here's a compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFFFfdAvsiM&list=PL-ON22n0bynEHy9rH9qQ6QZaN6PDa1V_c).

{{< recap id="02" title="Jellystone" image="Jellystone-KA-crop_1000x600.jpg" link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellystone!" >}}
Imagine most Hanna Barbera characters as citizens of a town. The character design update honors the simplicity (and cheapness) of characters, but slowly updating their behaviors and manias.

It's zany, chaotic, with each episode on one character, but enough of a peek of secondary ones.

{{< recap id="03" title="Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!" image="The-Eizouken-Cropped.avif" link="https://www.crunchyroll.com/keep-your-hands-off-eizouken">}}
It captures the pure passion of animation through the eyes of three kids who come together to create their own work. The
anime doesn’t shy away from the challenges and technical details involved, showing that passion alone isn’t enough.

The city itself is a character, with its multi-layered, uneven structure, a la China's Chongqing. Think multi-level tekkonkinkret. It’s a
vibrant, imaginative world that really brings their dreams to life.

{{< recap id="04" title="Orb: on the Movements of the Earth" image="GmLr_wCbAAAPYLY.jpg" link="https://www.netflix.com/title/81765022">}}
The story of how heliocentrism came to be, even if censored by Church and its inquisition. It jumps to like 3 groups, focusing on how knowledge is passed on even with constant threat (of torture, of heresy), with characters' motivations, fears and hopes.

The anime explores the sacrifices made to preserve and share knowledge in the face of an oppressive system who claimed to be eternal.

Overall I love how the Japanese describe European story: mainly as passionate fanatics with zero chill.

{{< recap id="05" title="Heavenly Delusion" image="heavenly.webp" link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Delusion">}}
It's full of mysteries to be solved, and hopefully a season 2 coming. It has monsters and a post apocalyptic society but it's less dystopian and more... like poor people live. Gangs, agreements, loyalties and friendships while dealing with hardships.

Although people miss central government, they adapt to limited resources and form various factions, which feels relatable and grounded.

On the other hand, you have the dome, where children are raised in isolation, completely unaware of the outside world. Spolier alert, at some point dome-0kids manage to escape, see sky first time in their life, and some get so upset by it they decide to return. They live a life of constant vigilance, they saw freedom as another test to pass.

{{< recap id="06" title="The Apothecary Diaries" image="apothecary2.avif" link="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GG5H5XQK4/the-apothecary-diaries">}}
yes, it glamorizes a ruthless moment in history, with patriarchy justifying its powers with celestial precision. But it's a fun af mystery story, and it's fun to see peoples personality even under the rigid hierarchy.

No it doesn't question power. But it slowly reveals how it affects them all.

{{< recap id="07" title="Frieren" image="frieren6.avif" link="https://www.crunchyroll.com/frieren-beyond-journeys-end" >}}
Alexithymia (the difficulty of identifying one’s own emotions) is a common condition in autistic people. They need time to debrief events, to make sense what it means to them.

In Frieren, the story starts in the end, after they defeat the entire demonic race, allowing humans to thrive. Frieren lived for almost a millenia before, and will go on to live millenia more and gets to debrief what the most important event for humanity means for her, the remaining living hero while promising to be more present in human's lives (that for them, is a blink of the eye).

The show captures the complexity of mage politics and the subtleties of power dynamics without dwelling too heavily on them. It's time-porn an epic trying to become a slice-of-life, superbly written.

{{< recap id="08" title="Delicious in Dungeon" image="delicious-in-dungeon-anime-serie.jpg" link="https://www.crunchyroll.com/delicious-in-dungeon" >}}
What started as a joke (an edutainment manga teaches you how to cook mythical creatures) grew to be a fantastic story of different races, dungeons as nuclear secrets between longer races (elves and dwarves). All characters are beautifully designed: to the level of their belongings, how they love, what they value, their food and fashion preferences, fears and aspirations.

I read the entire manga and decided to jump to anime too. I'm looking forward to season 2.

I always took fantasy RPG as inherently misogynistic, a power fantasy, and Delicious in Dungeon proved it's not the case at all, with poignant characters.

{{< recap id="09" title="Common Side Effects" image="common-side-effects-lead.jpg.webp" link="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/common-side-effects/eaa21376-a54d-4245-95d6-a86dce6313c8" >}}
Another animation with superb characters: their mannerisms, how their (sometimes shallow) values surface under tension, how they live, their conflicts and allegiances.

A miracle appears on earth: a mushroom that cures all illnesses. And how we manage to fuck it up, proving we're unworthy of gifts. Or maybe we are. Life is hard, with or without miracles.

Remembering how much characters tried and how little they accomplished makes me wanna cry. Again. It's a short enough story, and it's a must watch.

{{< recap id="10" title="Dandadan" image="10-funniest-dandadan-characters-ranked.avif" link="https://www.crunchyroll.com/dandadan" >}}
Another one that I went from manga to anime, shit is fucking BEAUTIFUL and demented.

They blend traditional japanese ghost stories with aliens (many aliens, some allies, some enemies, some in-between) and cryptozoology, and absurd battles. By questioning tradition and forging alliances, they awake old powers that helps them on next challenge.

Check also this content creator arguing that [Dandandan is feminist](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOyqy08EeA1/), dealing with redpill, manosphere issues with applomb, inspiring what it means to be a hero in a fucked up patriarchal world.

{{< recap id="11" title="Yurei Deco" image="yurei-deco-blogroll-1656802208166.jpg" link="https://www.crunchyroll.com/yurei-deco" end="true" >}}
A near-future sci-fi anime about perception, surveillance, and the social economy of belief. They start with the "perfect" society, to then flip to the have-nots, and the resistance.

The leader of the resistance is a non-binary mysterious character that refuses to be boxed in. Others join, under their own motivations, to topple the regime, gaslighted into forgetting lovers, and refusing to comply.

Meanwhile, both sides are displayed in a kawaii, soft atmosphere, with whimsical aesthetics, while they battle for less opressive epistemologies.
