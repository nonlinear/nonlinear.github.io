{{< recap id="01" image="Absolute-Martian-Manhunter-2-e1745772667954.webp" title="Absolute Martian Manhunter" link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Martian_Manhunter" >}}
I tend not to go to superhero comics much because they're too manichean of a lore, not the right stories to tell in a world in the brink of revolution, of oligarchs and new peasantry. They equate doing good with being good, they're carceral and cryptofascist.

But DC has a weird, psychedelic side, and Martian Manhunter is one of it. It's beautifully drawn and written. Yes, cop is possessed by an alien to fix systemic issues that institution cannot is a trope, it's part of the lore, but some know how to do great with it.

It alternates between the perspectives of animals and humans: The animals are puzzled by humans, with a wide range of people from different age groups and walks of life.

Animals and humans debate the intriguing mystery of the human race, a true slice of life, or lives.

incredibly well-written and illustrated, a Vedic perspective on kaiju and fighters, exploring endless cycles of conflict across dimensions and millennia, showcasing how new cooperations are formed from past resentments, fueling the next cycle.

Ultraviolent and chaotic in very different configurations, with exhausted and scarred characters. A compelling, gritty exploration of the cyclical nature of conflict and its impact on
society.

{{< recap id="04" title="Napalm Lullaby" link="https://doomrocket.com/napalm-lullaby-1-2024-review/" image="napalm-lullaby-10.jpg" >}}
There's a common and annoying trope where you're presented with a supremacist empire full of pride on one side, and the act of rebels to topple it... Only to twist it revealing that the leader of the rebels is part of nobility.

It's counterrevolutionary fantasy, co-opting rebel literature back to eugenicist supremacist ideals. We move from "supremacist empire uses narratives of superiority to justify material and spiritual oppression" to "supremacists must care for their own because only noble ressentment can topple them". It turns geopolitics into racist family dynamics.

Napalm Lullaby falls to this trope, sadly. Characters are fantastic, worldbuilding is amazing, and... a cheap supremacist trope. Meh.

Sex-positive and European-style illustrations: fluid, fun. I'm new to Mirka Andolfo and in love!

There's a strong emphasis on how people’s kinks connect to their personalities and how kink exploration contribute to their growth as individuals.

A coming-of-age queer story.

I like stories where teenagers are shown as the confused mess they are, but also their struggles at making sense of their needs.

It delves into the inner workings of a fascist state, from its formation to its (hopefully) collapse.

It shows motivations of both sides, the glorious fascist cop and the resistance, and how they relate with one another.

{{< recap id="08" title="Snotgirl" link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snotgirl" image="snotgirl-on-phone.avif" >}}
The life of an LA fashion influencer, prone to catastrophizing (impostor syndrome?) and her fashionable friends. I love how they dodge her dramas, even tho story is written from her POV.

It's same author as Scott Pilgrim, so expect sex- and kink-friendly content, and a magical realism that is never in your face.

Gotta say it's a sign of good writing when teenage stories represent adults well, to the point you root for them.

The story is on a crime-obsessed suburbia (seriously, all entertainment is about crime and punishment) and a family trying to hold things together. I fell in love with the gen-x mom, with a hardcore musical past, navigating control and rediscovery, all while balancing her own anxieties (and panic syndrome) and pride in her children.
