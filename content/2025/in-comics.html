{{< recap id="01" image="Absolute-Martian-Manhunter-2-e1745772667954.webp" title="Absolute Martian Manhunter" link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Martian_Manhunter" >}}
I tend not to go to superhero comics much because they're too manichean of a lore, not the right stories to tell in a world in the brink of revolution, of oligarchs and new peasantry. They equate doing good with being good, they're carceral and cryptofascist.

But DC has a weird, psychedelic side, and Martian Manhunter is one of it. It's beautifully drawn and written. Yes, cop is possessed by an alien to fix systemic issues that institution can is a trope, it's part of the lore, but some know how to do great with it.

It alternates between the perspectives of animals and humans: The animals are puzzled by humans, with a wide range of people from different age groups and walks of life. Animals and humans debate the intriguing mystery of the human race, a true slice of life, or lives.

{{< recap id="03" title="Ultramega" image="ultramega.jpg" link="https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/ultramega" >}}
incredibly well-written and illustrated, a Vedic perspective on kaiju and fighters, exploring endless cycles of conflict across dimensions and millennia, showcasing how new cooperations are formed from past ressentments, fueling the next cycle. Ultraviolent and chaotic in very different configurations, with exhausted and scarred characters. A compelling, gritty exploration of the cyclical nature of conflict and its impact on
society.

{{< recap id="04" title="Napalm Lullaby" link="https://doomrocket.com/napalm-lullaby-1-2024-review/" image="napalm-lullaby-10.jpg" >}}
THere's a common and annoying trope where you're presented with a supremacist empire full of pride on one side, and the act of rebels to topple it... Only to twist it revealing that the leader of the rebels is part of nobility.

It's counterrevolutionary fantasy, coopting rebel literature back to eugenicist supremacist ideals. We move from "supremacist empire opresses us materially and psychically with stories of superiority" to "supremacists must care for their own because only themselves can topple their dynasty, thru resentment.

Napalm Lullaby falls to this trope, sadly. Characters are fantastic, worldbuilding is amazing, and... a cheap supremacist trope. Meh.
