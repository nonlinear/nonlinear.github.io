{{< recap id="01" title="Shaping Things" link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100282.Shaping_Things" image="image001.png.webp" >}}
A scifi exploration on objects with digital shadows, and what it means for society.

This one is a reread for a circular design project: our society knows full well what happens to products until they're purchased, but has not a clue (or cares about) what happens after they're bought. A digital shadow means we can track not only how it's assembled, but how it's discarded and somewhat of how it's been used (by pairings).

Tracking is creepy, but we can't prescribe changes without describing it.

The history and culture of Brazil from before colonizers came, and a little bit of the struggle, alliances, and resistance once they arrive.

{{< recap id="03" title="Marx in the Anthropocene" link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784441-marx-in-the-anthropocene" image="3102.jpg" >}}

Although capitalism is (rightfully) blamed by our environmental crisis, reading this book made me realize that western world (capitalist or communist) has a fixation on growth and labor.

Nature, for them, is "anything untouched by human labor". And human labor is seen as the highest quality. They have no concept of neighbors, of what's neither *for* us neither *about* us.

The only agents they see are other humans, assuming they can exercise it. It's dishartening, most of the time reading communist ideology feels like dead white men gossip, and at some point you ask "what's even the point".

And author does a great job to unearth what marxists think of environmental degradation, the issue of our times, you end up with a western, male-centric approach that can't even consider how we impact non-human agents. Frankly they can't even *see* them. Like most western thought, they only consider what they can measure, and they omit a lot to close the books.

{{< recap id="04" title="Chimeras: Inventory of synthetic cognition" image="Chimeras_Ilan_Manouach_and_Anna_Engelhardt-pu.width-2560_I3IiEG1.jpg" link="https://www.onassis.org/culture/publications/chimeras-inventory-of-synthetic-cognition">}}
A rapid-fire of eerie terms to familiarize with the weird world we're about to encounter as human interiority becomes legible by machines.

Although book is thick, it's all 2-3 pages per concept, then next. It's a great read and food for thought.

{{< recap id="05" title="Heavenly Tyrant"  image="iron-widow-book-cover.jpg.webp"link="https://xiranjayzhao.com/index.php/heavenly-tyrant/">}}
I promised to jump to Xiran Jay Zhao at earliest possibility, but I miscalculated my jump and went staight to book 2. Oh well. She does a great job to explain the world either way, so we're good.

It’s the second book in the Iron Widow series, blending science fiction and fantasy with Chinese history and mythology.

It's mecha, spiritual warfare, thawed historical figures, laborist revolution against Gods.

{{< recap id="06" title="Earthsea Series" link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13662.A_Wizard_of_Earthsea"  image="IMG_3677.jpg" >}}

I've read both A Wizard of Earthsea and The Tombs of Atuan by Ursula K. Le Guin. I love how she explains the true names magick, and how wizards sta began in 1968 with "A Wizard of Earthsea." The series is a cornerstone of
fantasy literature, following the wizard Ged as he grows and learns about power and balance.

The books are known for their poetic language, deep themes, and unique world-building. They explore identity, coming of
age, and the consequences of magic.

I read these in 2025. If you want classic fantasy with depth, Earthsea is essential.

{{< recap id="07" title="The Velvet Rage" link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39700.The_Velvet_Rage" image="PinkTie.jpg" end="true" >}}

It is a mix of memoir, psychology, and self-help by Alan Downs, first published in 2005, focusing on the experiences of gay men in modern society.

The book explores the roots of shame, the search for validation, and the journey toward self-acceptance. It is widely cited in LGBTQ+ discussions and therapy.

I read it in 2025. It’s insightful and honest, offering both personal stories and practical advice.
