{{< recap id="01" title="88rhapsody" image="IMG_2538.jpg" link="https://anilist.co/manga/127262/88rhapsody/" >}}
Yaoi that focuses on a self-deprecating keyboard player who’s admired by others but doesn’t see himself as cool.

I love the minimal artstyle, and how it portrays an underground, feel-good gay romance. It’s an easy read.

{{< recap id="02" title="Blue Period" image="blue-period-anime-name.avif" link="https://anilist.co/manga/107237/Blue-Period/" >}}
It follows the journey of a character who transitions from being a sort of bad-boy jock into the world of art. He’s
someone who’s always lived for others, striving to appear effortless and cool, and now he’s exploring his own identity
through art.

The manga dives into both the personal journey of self-discovery and the technical challenges of art, like
composition, color, and the pressure of maintaining a vision.

Eventually I let it go because it falls into the "life is hard do your best" of most edutainment manga.

{{< recap id="03" title="The Wandering of Girls' Pair" image="0xq3hoqfzl881.png" link="https://anilist.co/manga/53306/Dainana-Joshikai-Houkou/" >}}
A zany manga set in a peculiar future where reality, dreams, and technology blend in playful, sometimes absurd ways.

We have a ghost friend mediated by tech and warning robots from the future.

Society will change as our interiority becomes legible to machines, so it's kind of cool to see a future that explore that weirdness with a sense of awe.
