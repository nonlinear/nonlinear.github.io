**US Patent 12121150**

Check out what some of our early customers have to say about Mag2

Built-in and top-mounted webcams make it nearly impossible to create a human connection. You're stuck either looking at the person on your screen and appearing disconnected to them, or you’re looking at the camera and can’t see the person on your screen.

By putting your webcam directly in front of your screen, you can maintain eye contact while reading a script, referencing notes, or looking at your audience. Plus you'll have noticeably better framing by positioning your webcam at eye level rather than above your head — no more unflattering angles!

When mounting Mag2 and your favorite USB-C webcam (with cable removed), you'll instantly stand out by appearing more confident, engaging, and trustworthy.

### Build trust and rapport

Traditional webcam mounts and built-in webcams sit above your natural line of sight, leading to a lack of eye contact. With Mag2 you'll appear more trustworthy and engaged by not looking distracted or uncertain.

### Never miss a beat

By positioning your webcam near your gaze with Mag2 you can keep track of your notes, presentation, script, or audience while still leaving a lasting impression.

### Stay connected on-the-go

Lightweight and ultra-portable, Mag2 is the perfect travel solution for road warriors looking to turn any airport lounge or hotel room into a studio setup. World-renowned body language expert, keynote speaker, and bestselling author Mark Bowden called it "a great, simple, small travel setup".

### 

Mag2 is designed to work with **a wide variety of** webcams that use a USB-C port on the back of the webcam *(note that webcams with an integrated and non-detachable cord will not work since Mag2 attaches to the built-in USB-C port on the webcam).* We chose USB-C because it's compatible with the best webcams on the market. And our Patented Zero-Footprint™ mounting system makes Mag2 nearly invisible.

Mag2 attaches directly to your screen using display-safe™ magnetic coupling. It's a little known fact that nearly every modern monitor on the market has enough magnetic materials behind the screen to support magnetic mounting.

Rest assured, using magnets to attach your webcam to your display is perfectly safe for modern monitors like LCD and LED screens. Unlike older CRT monitors, today's displays are not affected by magnetic fields, so you can confidently use our magnetic attachment without worrying about any damage to your screen.

For laptops and other non-magnetic screens, we include a backplate to provide support from behind your screen. Mag2 and the backplate are both coated in a non-static rubberized material that will prevent scratches to your screen and case.
