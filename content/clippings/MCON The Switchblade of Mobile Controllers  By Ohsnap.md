Hey, we’re Ohsnap! We’re a North Carolina-based mobile accessory brand driven to find better ways to use your phone. We’re known for creating ultra-functional, ultra-thin phone grips with a focus on premium materials and usability. 

We already have 6 previous successful crowdfunding campaigns (3 on Kickstarter, 3 on Indiegogo), each of which has been fulfilled on schedule.

Launch spring will be hidden on production version

Press down on both buttons at the same time to activate MCON’s auto sliding mechanism that magically reveals the controller from behind your phone and simultaneously slides your screen into the optimal angled position for gaming.

Adapter will look more refined in final version.

We designed the MCON to adapt seamlessly to the wide variety of phone shapes, sizes, and camera bump heights, all while keeping it as slim as possible. To achieve this, each MCON comes with two “pucks”, which are thin, 2.5mm discs with embedded MagSafe magnet arrays. Here’s how it works: 

1\. Adapting to Your Phone:  
• The pucks attach to the steel plate on the MCON, which is what your phone mounts to.  
• If your phone has a larger camera bump, like a caseless iPhone 16 (camera bump ~4.5mm), you’ll stack two pucks to ensure proper clearance.  
• For phones with smaller camera bumps, like an iPhone 12 (~2mm), one puck is usually enough.  
• If you’re using a case, the case itself often acts as a spacer, so you might only need one puck or none at all.

2\. For Phones & Cases Without MagSafe:  
We’ve included a MagSafe adapter in the box. This is a 2mm-thick disc with adhesive on one side. If your phone or case doesn’t have MagSafe (e.g., most Android phones), simply stick the adapter onto your phone or case. The adapter enables your phone to work seamlessly with the MCON system. By stacking the pucks as needed, you can customize the MCON to fit your phone perfectly, no matter the camera bump or case situation. 

Many manufacturers also make MagSafe cases for non-MagSafe phones if you want to avoid adhering a disc to your phone.

#### Platform Compatibility

Our goal is to natively support iOS, Android, Xbox and PC/Mac. PlayStation is it's own thing and is a bit unknown at this point. 

#### Will my phone work?

MCON is designed to adapt to any smartphone. The only outliers are vertical flip phones (like Z-Flip or Razr), but based on feedback, we are working on designing different plates as an option that justifies the MagSafe puck further to the side. We will provide more updates on that as we develop it.

\* MCON will not work on your grandma's flip phone or any phone without bluetooth.

Full size Hall-effect joysticks are an absolute must for controlled precision AND durability. These sticks are also MUCH less prone to stick drift, common on controllers like the Switch.

MCONs silent buttons produce super quiet and fluid gameplay without disturbing your environment. We'll consider this campaign a success if MCON is banned from classrooms <3

Measuring just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, the MCON is compact enough to fit into any pocket, purse, or backpack. It charges via USB-C in 30 minutes and delivers weeks of gaming on a single charge.

We're nerds, you're a nerd. Let's customize, modify, and repair the things we buy so that we can spend less and generate less waste. MCON can be taken apart with a simple TORX screwdriver so you can do whatever you want.

Mockup packaging

- MCON Bluetooth Controller
- USB-C Cable: For charging & connecting to non-bluetooth devices.
- 2 Magnetic Pucks: These space your camera bumps away from the controller so your phone stays level. Use 1 or 2 depending on phone and phone case.
- Adhesive MagSafe Adapter: Adhere this thin adapter to Androids and older iPhones (11 and below) so they can magnetically attach to MCON. You can also replace this functionality with a MagSafe case.

### Estimated Shipping Costs

Below is our estimate for standard shipping charges. Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.

Taxes, Customs, and Duties:  
We want to make sure the entire process is clear and straightforward. Here's what to expect:

- Taxes: Any applicable taxes, including sales tax or VAT, will be calculated during the post-campaign survey. These amounts will be included in your final transaction total.
- Customs and Duties: International backers outside the USA and Canada may be required to pay customs or duty fees upon delivery. These charges are determined by your local authorities, and while we can’t control them, we’ll make sure the necessary details are communicated clearly.
- Your Responsibility: Tax related charges will need to be covered by you to receive your reward. If unpaid, your shipment might be returned, and additional costs could apply.
- Questions: If you have questions about customs, duties, or VAT, we recommend reaching out to your local customs office for more information.

#### Where's my country?

Unfortunately we are only able to support certain countries right now, as shipping and warrantying products in some countries is extremely difficult. If you do not see your country on the list, the product will likely not be available. Check back in just in case!

#### How can I purchase multiple?

Simply multiply the price you paid by the number of controllers you would like! For example: The super early bird tier is $99, if I wanted to purchase 3, I would pledge $297 for that tier. You can only purchase more at the price tier you backed at. You will be able to pick the color for each controller individually after the campaign is over!

### Stretch Goal

UNLOCKED!! We wanted to launch a special color that will be an EXCLUSIVE option to crowdfunding backers, but we also want to motivate you to tell your friends to support the project! If we hit the goal of $1M, then this color option will be available to you when you choose your color at the end. We're extending the super early bird for a few more days, so go tell your friends and family to grab MCON at it's lowest price! I'm sure they'll want a super nerdy clear version too.

MCON is the product of over 2 years of development! Josh King (Eternal Progression on YouTube) is the brainchild of this fantastic idea.
