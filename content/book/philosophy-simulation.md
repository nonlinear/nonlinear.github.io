## The Emergence of Synthetic Reason

## Introduction Emergence in History

> the absence of novelty in physical interactions meant that explaining their effects could be reduced to deduction from general principles or laws

> But the synthesis of water does produce something new, not new in the absolute sense of something that has never existed before but only in the relative sense that something emerges that was not in the interacting entities acting as causes

> But there are many other physical mechanisms that are nonlinear

> This shape is emergent because the metallic atoms making up the knife must be arranged in a very particular way for it to be triangular

> a capacity may remain only potential if it is never actually exercised.

> very different ontological status between properties and capacities

> when the capacity does become actual it is not as a state, like the state of being sharp, but as an event, an event that is always double: to cut-to be cut.

> while properties can be specified without reference to anything else capacities to affect must always be thought in relation to capacities to be affected

> the ontological relation between properties and capacities displays a complex symmetry

> The main difference between tendencies and capacities is that while the former are typically finite the latter need not be.

> Since neither tendencies nor capacities must be actual to be real it would be tempting to give them the status of possibilities.

> specifying the structure of the space of possibilities

> studied through the imposition of a certain arrangement

> the only discontinuities are the critical points separating the different tendencies.

> the structure of possibility spaces plays as great a role in the explanation of emergence as do mechanisms

> formed a pyramid of progressively ascending grades

> prebiotic soup, bacterial ecosystems, insect intelligence, mammalian memory, primate social strategies, and the emergence of trade, language, and institutional organizations in human communities

## Chapter One: The Storm in the Computer

> But temperature and pressure are in fact irreducible because they are the result of an objective averaging process

> intensive properties

> gradients

> The death of a thunderstorm, in turn, is linked to processes that counteract its sustaining gradients: the higher the air reaches the colder it gets, the more saturated it becomes, and the larger the liquid drops and ice crystals that condense from it

> the form created by the gradient to cancel itself.

> the updraft sucks the air from the center of the tornado greatly reducing the pressure inside of it compared to that of the outside.7

> we can explain how it is born, how it lives, and how it dies

> one scale

> emergent entities at that scale can become the component parts of a whole at a larger scale

> gradients of matter not of energy.

> asymptotic stability.

> Not all oscillating entities possess this kind of stability

> mechanism-independent component

> properties, tendencies, and capacities

> stable emergent property is “indifferent” to local changes in the interactions that give rise to it

> mechanism-independence: if processes as different in detail as a convection cell and a chemical clock can exhibit the same behavior perhaps mathematical equations can also display that behavior.

> geometrically similar.10

> the fact that the geometric similarity has persisted has made the underlying behavioral isomorphism even more problematic

> To everyone’s surprise a central pillar, an anvil, a dome, and a flanking line of clouds spontaneously emerged despite the fact that none of those features had been explicitly modeled

> natural phenomena exhibit a recurrent part-to-whole relation

> This isomorphism has mystified physicists for as long as there has been evidence of its existence

> The ontological status of both tendencies and capacities is therefore different from that of properties

> an unmanifested tendency and an unexercised capacity are not just possible but define a concrete space of possibilities with a definite structure.

> ity. The structure of this space can be conceived as the subset of those points that have a much higher probability to become actual. When we described the mechanism of emergence

> the stability of emergent properties is explained by the structure of a possibility space and the fact that this stability can be displayed by entirely different mechanisms

> and non-metric spaces exemplified by a variety of other geometries: projective, differential, topological.

> When we do this a space ceases to be a set of coordinate addresses and becomes a field of rapidities and slownesses

> The structure of an abstract space, in turn, can be characterized by those properties that remain unchanged when the space is transformed, when it is moved

> the existence and distribution of special or remarkable points (or sets of such points) called singularities.

> the possibilities with the highest probability of occurring are topological singularities acting as attractors.
Let’s now apply this line of

> To create a mathematical model the first step is to enumerate all the relevant ways in which the process to be modeled is free to change.

> the art of mathematical modeling being based in part on the ability to judge what changes do, and what changes do not, make a difference

> It was by observing the tendency of many of these trajectories to converge on specific areas of state space, to converge on singularities, that the existence of asymptotic stability was first established.15

> a mathematical model can capture the behavior of a material process because the space of possible solutions overlaps the possibility space associated with the material process.

> The two possibility spaces need not be identical but merely overlapping

> Once this ontological commitment has been made the term “singularity” ceases to be a purely mathematical concept and becomes a properly philosophical one.

> If all the matter and energy of the universe ceased to exist, would singularities also disappear (immanent) or would they continue to exist (transcendent)?

> It can be proved, for example, that in a two-dimensional space only certain kinds of singularities exist: four different types of point singularities distinguished from each other by the form of the flow of nearby trajectories (nodes, saddle points, foci, and centers)

> In three-dimensional spaces, the four point singularities are still part of the repertoire but now periodic singularities come in three different forms: stable, unstable, and saddle-shaped loops

> one that can be pictured as a loop that has been repeatedly stretched and folded

> nature of the gradient (thermal, gravitational, mechanical, chemical)

> State space is only one kind of possibility space, a space useful to study tendencies but not capacities.

> entities can exercise their capacities in interaction with a potentially innumerable variety of other entities

> interactions in which capacities are exercised can be staged in a simulation

> until the singular features of the possibility space are made visible.

> how staging a different type of simulated interaction (chemical, biological, social) can tease out the singular structure of their possibility spaces.

## Chapter Two: Cellular Automata and Patterns of Flow

> The simplest of all computing machines, finite state automata, can perform a computation by changing from one state to another in a well-defined sequence without having to store intermediate results.

> cells may be triangular, rectangular, hexagonal, or any shape that exactly tiles the plane so that the cells are connected to one another by sharing edges and corners

> emergent properties, tendencies, and capacities, and

> that are not present in the individual automata

> the tendency to remain in a steady state and the tendency to oscillate between states.

> most initial patterns disappear after a few generations.

> Gliders and other spaceships provide the clearest example of emergence in cellular automata

> There is a collision of 13 gliders, for instance, that synthesizes a pattern more complex than the glider itself: a glider gun

> a finite state automaton represents a capacity minimum while a so-called Turing machine represents a capacity maximum

> computing machines can be built out of basic digital circuits called logical gates

> a simple Turing machine capable of being in three different states and using three symbols to write in its memory tape

> Since this is all a rule does, defining the transition from one state to the next, the total number of rules is the number of states raised to the number of possible configuration of states for a neighborhood

> class IV sandwiched between class II and class III and occupying a zone much smaller than the zones on either side of it.10

> a universal Turing machine is an automaton that can simulate any special purpose Turing machine,

> its memory tape including among other things an executable symbolic description of the automaton it is supposed to simulate.

> the cheaper and more abundant their memory the closer the approximation

> lattice-gas automata

> scientific models take advantage of the decomposability of reality made possible by emergent properties

> the state space for a single molecule is already six-dimensional, the space of possibilities for the whole population being literally unsurveyable

> exports its own disorder elsewhere? In fluid dynamics these situations are called “instabilities” because the existence of a live gradient is unstable

> as the heavy fluid invades and displaces the light one.

> conservation and symmetry

> Symmetry refers to the indifference that the regularities in the behavior of molecular populations display to being transformed in certain ways

> But with lattice-gas automata we can actually follow the molecular population until it reaches a given spatial arrangement

> several runs of the same simulation can be carried out changing the values assigned to certain parameters and tracking the unfolding process to check whether it arrives at the same final state.

> varying them in different runs is equivalent to checking whether the outcome is robust to changes in the assumptions.

> computer simulations may be thought as occupying

> an intermediate position between that of formal theory and laboratory experiment.19

> the chemistry of the prebiotic soup

> those that retain their identity (catalysts) are capable of affecting that synthesis by accelerating it or decelerating it.

> after this chain has folded into a three-dimensional form, an enzyme is an entity with the capacity to act on other chains breaking them up or gluing them together

> When a computer program is copied from one hard disk to another, for example, it is treated as a mere chain of ones and zeroes, but when it is executed it becomes a procedure that can perform a variety of operations on other chains of ones and zeroes

> a complex program can be built using a part-to-whole relation:

> one as a program (enzyme) and the other as data (target substrate)

> Because recursive function languages have the computational capacity of the most sophisticated automata, and because of the random character of the collisions, this artificial chemistry is referred to as a Turing gas.10

> for is the relatively simple process through which an RNA molecule can serve as a template for the creation of a copy of itself.

> a new kind of gradient, a gradient of fitness.

> fitness differences act just like temperature differences

> the moment the differences disappear the selection process stops.1

> An RNA molecule is simply a sequence of four possible nucleotides, each member of the set displaying clear tendencies to bond with just another member

> Given these tendencies a sequence of nucleotides can create a copy of itself using a mechanism similar to that of conventional photography: first a “negative” is created as complementary monomers attach themselves one by one to the template, and then a “positive print” is produced from that negative

> the space of possible genes; the space of possible structural proteins and enzymes that these genes code for; and the space of possible spatial structures and metabolic pathways that the structural proteins and enzymes can form

> the space of possible cell types (such as muscle, bone, nerve, blood); the space of possible tissues and organs these cells can form; and the space of possible organisms these tissues and organs can compose.

> naked RNA has a very simple relation between genotype and phenotype: the unfolded polymer constitutes the former while the folded version and its catalytic capacities constitutes the latter.

> the space of folded forms,

> a smaller space given that several different sequences of nucleotides can end up with equivalent folded forms.3

> every possible polymer is in direct contact with all its one-mutant neighbors and a series of neighbors forms a connected path for evolution to follow

> Fitness refers in this case to the consequences for reproductive success of the catalytic capacities that each polymer would have if it were folded into a three-dimensional shape

> A possibility space of self-replicating entities to which fitness values have been assigned is called a fitness landscape.

> In many contemporary organisms there are enduring symbioses in which bacteria in the guts of larger animals allow the latter to digest food they could not otherwise process, but the microorganisms must be re-ingested every generation.
