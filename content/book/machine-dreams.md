## Economics Becomes a Cyborg Science    

> cyborg science tended to parse its dynamics in terms of basins of attraction; due to its ontological commitment to dissipation, it imagined situations where a plurality of attractors existed, with the codicil that stochastic consid- erations could tip a system from one to another instantaneously

> Transmission required some redundancy, which was given a precise measure with the information concept; it was needed because sometimes noise could be confused with signal and, perhaps stranger, sometimes noise could boost signal. For the neoclassicals, on the other hand, noise was just waste; and the existence of redundancy was simply a symptom of inefficiency, a sign that someone, somewhere, was not optimizing

> We show that it is a sort of memory facility, manifested by a system where measurements occur, that might cause a permanent decrease of entropy and thus a violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, were it not for the fact that the mea- surements themselves are necessarily accompanied by the production of entropy
