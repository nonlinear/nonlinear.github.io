title: Free usability consulting for commons

I’m an usability/UI-UX/product designer offering one-hour consulting sessions for open source projects.

In the session, we will validate some assumptions together, to get a sense of where your product is, and where it could go.

I’ll provide focused, practical feedback, and propose some directions.

In return you help me map the state of usability in open source, and we all help community by doing something for commons.

## Reach out if:

- Your project reached a plateau, and needs traction
- You're lost on which features to focus on, and need a roadmap
- You are a dev with no personalproject and considering starting one, and needs help deciding on what's needed/wanted

This offer is only valid for non profit, open source projects.

If that works for you, [set some time on calendar](https://zcal.co/nonlinear/commons)
