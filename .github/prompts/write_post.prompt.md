# Write post

Write a Mastodon post in the style of the #creativecode posts at https://social.praxis.nyc/tags/creativecode.

The post should:

- Start with a creativity- or tech-related emoji.
- Briefly describe the experiment or project (e.g., "interactive trading card with parallax, gyroscope, and shine effect").
- Quickly mention the technologies used or challenges solved (e.g., modal only for touchscreen, iOS support, etc).
- Include a public link to the project (e.g., https://***REMOVED***.github.io/tradingcard/).
- End with relevant hashtags (#creativecode, #webdev, #generativeart, etc).

Example structure:

🎨✨ New #creativecode experiment: [short project description].
Tested on [platforms/devices], highlight: [feature/challenge].
See the result and open code:
