   - Core narrative/story
   - Key messages per platform
   - Visual identity guidelines

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Platform-specific tactics
   - Content calendar framework
   - Metrics/goals
   - Quick wins vs long-term

## Use Case

```
Me: *runs research prompt on Nicholas's work*
    "Analyzing nonlinear.nyc, GitHub projects, writing..."
    
    "Themes detected:
     - AI/ML integration (Librarian, OpenClaw)
     - Design systems (Storybook, ReX)
     - Knowledge management (notes, commons garden)
     - Creative coding + publishing
     
    Unique angle:
     - Meta-cognitive tooling (AI assists human thought)
     - Bridge between design/dev/AI
     - Documentation as craft
     
    Suggested positioning:
     'AI-augmented knowledge worker who builds 
      tools for thinking and creating'"

Me: *elaborates strategy*
    "Platform breakdown:
     - GitHub: Technical depth, open source
     - nonlinear.nyc: Essays, experiments, portfolio
     - LinkedIn: Professional positioning
     - Twitter: Quick insights, work-in-progress
     
    Content pillars:
     1. AI + human collaboration
     2. Design systems + tooling
     3. Knowledge management
     4. Creative coding"
```
