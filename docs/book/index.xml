      <description>The Emergence of Synthetic Reason Introduction Emergence in History  the absence of novelty in physical interactions meant that explaining their effects could be reduced to deduction from general principles or laws
  But the synthesis of water does produce something new, not new in the absolute sense of something that has never existed before but only in the relative sense that something emerges that was not in the interacting entities acting as causes</description>

      <description>Making Kin in the Chthulucene  “to stir up,” “to make cloudy,” “to disturb.”
  The task is to make kin in lines of inventive connection as a practice of learning to live and die well with each other in a thick present
  Staying with the trouble does not require such a relationship to times called the future
  Nothing in kainos must mean conventional pasts, presents, or futures</description>

      <description>Economics Becomes a Cyborg Science  cyborg science tended to parse its dynamics in terms of basins of attraction; due to its ontological commitment to dissipation, it imagined situations where a plurality of attractors existed, with the codicil that stochastic consid- erations could tip a system from one to another instantaneously
  To those seeking a new theory of social organization, the neoclassicals retorted that all effective organizations were merely disguised versions of their notion of an ur-market</description>

      <description>A New History of Humanity 2 Wicked Liberty: The indigenous critique and the myth of progress  They brand us for slaves, and call us miserable souls, whose life is not worth having, alleging that we degrade ourselves in subjecting ourselves to one man [the king] who possesses all the power, and is bound by no law but his own will.

      <description>Whittling the collection down would feel like a kind of revisionism
  ‘Groundhog Cage’ she’d constructed that made thirty-day free-trial software think it was always on the first day of the trial
  I want to see if I can ride the coattails of the distribution
  So you’d be satisfied with passing as a low-affect psychopath, just so long as you don’t actually come across as brain-dead?</description>

      <description>How Mind Emerged from Matter  But it is not simply a many-to-one relationship; it is the mapping of a continuum to discrete states. Morphodynamic work shares one very significant attribute with thermodynamic work: the law of diminishing returns. As this tendency to complexity becomes amplified to a far greater extend when we consider the superimposition of teleodynamic processes. how the evolutionary process is able to mine the morphodynamic domain for these sorts of reciprocities and complementarities In general terms, an orthograde teleodynamic process is an end-directed process, and more specifically, one that will tend to occur spontaneously new teleodynamic systems and relationships are generated from the interactions of prior teleodynamic systems with respect to their shared environmental contexts teleodynamic processes because they are end-directed toward specific target states orthograde because they are what organism dynamics produce naturally and spontaneously Organisms are of course highly complicated synergistic constellations of teleodynamic processes But like other forms of work, teleodynamic work can also be used to transform one form of teleodynamic process into another, and to generate emergent phenomena at a higher order And since all ultimately depend on thermodynamic work, this is the final arbiter of teleodynamic success evolution is a kind of teleodynamic engine This shift of work up-level, so to speak, significantly decreases the total amount of thermodynamic work to achieve this end The diversity of forms of teleodynamic work is as extensive as the fields of biology, psychology, human social behavior, and all the arts combined.</description>

      <description>Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension  This is the thesis of the extended mind: when parts of the environment are coupled to the brain in the right way, they become parts of the mind. Parity Principle, which held that if aprocess in the world works in a way that we should count as a cognitive process if it were done in the head, then we should count it as a cognitive process all the same.</description>

      <description>Desvendando os Mistérios da Natureza Humana  Durante a maior parte do século XX, tudo o que tínhamos a oferecer em matéria de explicação do comportamento humano eram dois edifícios teóricos &amp;gt; o freudismo e o behaviorismo
 30 de outubro de 2016
 em sistemas biológicos há uma profunda unidade entre estrutura, função e origem. Não se pode fazer muito progresso na compreensão de qualquer desses aspectos a menos que se esteja também rigorosamente atento aos outros dois.</description>
