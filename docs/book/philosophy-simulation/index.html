<p>the absence of novelty in physical interactions meant that explaining their effects could be reduced to deduction from general principles or laws</p>

<p>But the synthesis of water does produce something new, not new in the absolute sense of something that has never existed before but only in the relative sense that something emerges that was not in the interacting entities acting as causes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>while properties can be specified without reference to anything else capacities to affect must always be thought in relation to capacities to be affected</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the ontological relation between properties and capacities displays a complex symmetry</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main difference between tendencies and capacities is that while the former are typically finite the latter need not be.</p>

<p>the fact that the geometric similarity has persisted has made the underlying behavioral isomorphism even more problematic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To everyone’s surprise a central pillar, an anvil, a dome, and a flanking line of clouds spontaneously emerged despite the fact that none of those features had been explicitly modeled</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>natural phenomena exhibit a recurrent part-to-whole relation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This isomorphism has mystified physicists for as long as there has been evidence of its existence</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ontological status of both tendencies and capacities is therefore different from that of properties</p>

<p>and non-metric spaces exemplified by a variety of other geometries: projective, differential, topological.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we do this a space ceases to be a set of coordinate addresses and becomes a field of rapidities and slownesses</p>

<p>The structure of an abstract space, in turn, can be characterized by those properties that remain unchanged when the space is transformed, when it is moved</p>

<p>To create a mathematical model the first step is to enumerate all the relevant ways in which the process to be modeled is free to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the art of mathematical modeling being based in part on the ability to judge what changes do, and what changes do not, make a difference</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was by observing the tendency of many of these trajectories to converge on specific areas of state space, to converge on singularities, that the existence of asymptotic stability was first established.15</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a mathematical model can capture the behavior of a material process because the space of possible solutions overlaps the possibility space associated with the material process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The two possibility spaces need not be identical but merely overlapping</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once this ontological commitment has been made the term “singularity” ceases to be a purely mathematical concept and becomes a properly philosophical one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If all the matter and energy of the universe ceased to exist, would singularities also disappear (immanent) or would they continue to exist (transcendent)?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It can be proved, for example, that in a two-dimensional space only certain kinds of singularities exist: four different types of point singularities distinguished from each other by the form of the flow of nearby trajectories (nodes, saddle points, foci, and centers)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In three-dimensional spaces, the four point singularities are still part of the repertoire but now periodic singularities come in three different forms: stable, unstable, and saddle-shaped loops</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The simplest of all computing machines, finite state automata, can perform a computation by changing from one state to another in a well-defined sequence without having to store intermediate results.</p>

<p>the tendency to remain in a steady state and the tendency to oscillate between states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>most initial patterns disappear after a few generations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gliders and other spaceships provide the clearest example of emergence in cellular automata</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a collision of 13 gliders, for instance, that synthesizes a pattern more complex than the glider itself: a glider gun</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a finite state automaton represents a capacity minimum while a so-called Turing machine represents a capacity maximum</p>

<blockquote>
<p>computing machines can be built out of basic digital circuits called logical gates</p>

<p>a simple Turing machine capable of being in three different states and using three symbols to write in its memory tape</p>

<blockquote>
<p>scientific models take advantage of the decomposability of reality made possible by emergent properties</p>

<p>the state space for a single molecule is already six-dimensional, the space of possibilities for the whole population being literally unsurveyable</p>

<blockquote>
<p>exports its own disorder elsewhere? In fluid dynamics these situations are called “instabilities” because the existence of a live gradient is unstable</p>

<p>as the heavy fluid invades and displaces the light one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>conservation and symmetry</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Symmetry refers to the indifference that the regularities in the behavior of molecular populations display to being transformed in certain ways</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But with lattice-gas automata we can actually follow the molecular population until it reaches a given spatial arrangement</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>several runs of the same simulation can be carried out changing the values assigned to certain parameters and tracking the unfolding process to check whether it arrives at the same final state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>varying them in different runs is equivalent to checking whether the outcome is robust to changes in the assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>computer simulations may be thought as occupying</p>

<p>an intermediate position between that of formal theory and laboratory experiment.19</p>

<p>the chemistry of the prebiotic soup</p>

<p>those that retain their identity (catalysts) are capable of affecting that synthesis by accelerating it or decelerating it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>molecular recognition, the simplest kind of which is a geometrical complementarity between two different molecules, one acting as a “lock” the other as a “key.”</p>

<p>Putting together these two capacities yields a catalyst</p>

<p>pushing it away from equilibrium and creating a gradient.</p>

<p>Some contemporary proteins, called enzymes, can act as more powerful and specific catalysts than metallic crystals</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the acceleration of bond creation to compensate for the spontaneous destruction promoted by an aqueous environment,</p>

<p>For enzymes to have this capacity their one-dimensional structure must be folded into a three-dimensional shape with the right geometric features. The</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we are considering possibility spaces that grow explosively as the length of the polymers increases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keeping track of the increase in the number of dimensions can be done by coupling a state space to a graph like the one just discussed</p>

<p>Thus, metadynamic simulations explore two coupled possibility spaces</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>after this chain has folded into a three-dimensional form, an enzyme is an entity with the capacity to act on other chains breaking them up or gluing them together</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a computer program is copied from one hard disk to another, for example, it is treated as a mere chain of ones and zeroes, but when it is executed it becomes a procedure that can perform a variety of operations on other chains of ones and zeroes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a complex program can be built using a part-to-whole relation:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one as a program (enzyme) and the other as data (target substrate)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because recursive function languages have the computational capacity of the most sophisticated automata, and because of the random character of the collisions, this artificial chemistry is referred to as a Turing gas.10</p>

<p>a new kind of gradient, a gradient of fitness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fitness differences act just like temperature differences</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the moment the differences disappear the selection process stops.1</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An RNA molecule is simply a sequence of four possible nucleotides, each member of the set displaying clear tendencies to bond with just another member</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Given these tendencies a sequence of nucleotides can create a copy of itself using a mechanism similar to that of conventional photography: first a “negative” is created as complementary monomers attach themselves one by one to the template, and then a “positive print” is produced from that negative</p>

<p>the copying errors or mutations that provide the necessary variability to prevent fitness gradients from disappearing do</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the possibility spaces associated with living organisms can become very numerous as the complexity of their part-to-whole organization increases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the space of possible genes; the space of possible structural proteins and enzymes that these genes code for; and the space of possible spatial structures and metabolic pathways that the structural proteins and enzymes can form</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the space of possible cell types (such as muscle, bone, nerve, blood); the space of possible tissues and organs these cells can form; and the space of possible organisms these tissues and organs can compose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>naked RNA has a very simple relation between genotype and phenotype: the unfolded polymer constitutes the former while the folded version and its catalytic capacities constitutes the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the space of folded forms,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a smaller space given that several different sequences of nucleotides can end up with equivalent folded forms.3</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>every possible polymer is in direct contact with all its one-mutant neighbors and a series of neighbors forms a connected path for evolution to follow</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fitness refers in this case to the consequences for reproductive success of the catalytic capacities that each polymer would have if it were folded into a three-dimensional shape</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A possibility space of self-replicating entities to which fitness values have been assigned is called a fitness landscape.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case selection pressures alone cannot dislodge the population from the trap</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one best catalyst surrounded by mutants declining smoothly in fitness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the landscape is structured by many local optima around which fitness decreases steeply. The first extreme makes evolution entirely predictable while the second one makes it entirely unfeasible</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s imagine a particular RNA polymer with very high fitness located at a local optimum with smooth slopes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the entire set forming a coherent cloud of mutants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a non-dominant mutant that is surrounded by very fit ones can out reproduce the dominant one</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nevertheless better at finding local optima of higher fitness than a random walk</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As before, it is the intermediate values that yield the interesting cases</p>

<p>as we consider more embodied replicators the relation between genotype and phenotype must be modeled in more detail</p>

<blockquote>
<p>simple forms of chemical circuitry (autocatalytic loops) could emerge in a soup of symbol strings belonging to a recursive function language, that is, in a Turing gas</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the overall metabolic task forms the root of the tree while progressively more detailed sub-tasks form the branches of the tree</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, genetic programming can tackle more challenging design problems</p>

<blockquote>
<p>given that complex programs are evolved by recursion, that is, by functions that result from the composition of simpler ones,</p>

<p>functions that insert a new component (a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor); functions that alter the connectivity</p>

<p>of those components (the topology of the circuit); and functions that set the intensity (or sizing) of a component, that is, the degree of resistance of a resistor, the capacitance of a capacitor, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any complex function that can be created from the elementary ones by recursion, on the other hand, can be considered</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The final step is to create a fitness function defining the problem to be solved</p>

<blockquote>
<p>isomorphism</p>

<p>This would involve discovering the topology and sizing of the network, that is, the connectivity of the different reactions and the values of the rates at which they proceed</p>
