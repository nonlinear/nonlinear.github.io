      <description>Link: Community Privacy Residency (2025) form  Short bio I am an UX designer working for almost a decade for a scientific publisher heavily invested in open access, and volunteering as a community organizer for open source/P2P initiatives on the side.
What is your motivation for joining the Community Privacy Residency? What would you like to receive from our time together? What do you hope to contribute? Designing for open source is notoriously difficult, and I am looking for a more product-based approach to solutions, partnering with required stakeholders and community leaders from the start, for more robust, usable solutions.</description>

      <description>I’m an usability/UI-UX/product designer offering one-hour consulting sessions for open source projects.
In the session, we will validate some assumptions together, to get a sense of where your product is, and where it could go.
I’ll provide focused, practical feedback, and propose some directions.
In return you help me map the state of usability in open source, and we all help community by doing something for commons.
Reach out if:  Your project reached a plateau, and needs traction You&amp;rsquo;re lost on which features to focus on, and need a roadmap You are a dev with no personalproject and considering starting one, and needs help deciding on what&amp;rsquo;s needed/wanted  This offer is only valid for non profit, open source projects.</description>

      <description>Economics Becomes a Cyborg Science  cyborg science tended to parse its dynamics in terms of basins of attraction; due to its ontological commitment to dissipation, it imagined situations where a plurality of attractors existed, with the codicil that stochastic consid- erations could tip a system from one to another instantaneously

      <description>How Mind Emerged from Matter  But it is not simply a many-to-one relationship; it is the mapping of a continuum to discrete states. Morphodynamic work shares one very significant attribute with thermodynamic work: the law of diminishing returns. As this tendency to complexity becomes amplified to a far greater extend when we consider the superimposition of teleodynamic processes. how the evolutionary process is able to mine the morphodynamic domain for these sorts of reciprocities and complementarities In general terms, an orthograde teleodynamic process is an end-directed process, and more specifically, one that will tend to occur spontaneously new teleodynamic systems and relationships are generated from the interactions of prior teleodynamic systems with respect to their shared environmental contexts teleodynamic processes because they are end-directed toward specific target states orthograde because they are what organism dynamics produce naturally and spontaneously Organisms are of course highly complicated synergistic constellations of teleodynamic processes But like other forms of work, teleodynamic work can also be used to transform one form of teleodynamic process into another, and to generate emergent phenomena at a higher order And since all ultimately depend on thermodynamic work, this is the final arbiter of teleodynamic success evolution is a kind of teleodynamic engine This shift of work up-level, so to speak, significantly decreases the total amount of thermodynamic work to achieve this end The diversity of forms of teleodynamic work is as extensive as the fields of biology, psychology, human social behavior, and all the arts combined.</description>

      <description>Apoorva&amp;rsquo;s Product Operating Model Principles e2e goal is to turn now-verticals into organs of this e2e superorganism.
an organ is a hyper-specialized adaptation, relegating redundant functions to an organism, and becoming dependent of it.
&amp;ldquo;streamilined approach&amp;rdquo; is the end-result of a successful de-verticalization
Platforms power products: YES! platforms are the shadow policies that products grow from, when needed.
Product-driven sales, not sales-driven product: YES! Wiley is too reactive, just working on what&amp;rsquo;s asked of them, based on requests or hunches.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s my initial list on how to migrate from Figma to storybook for design Deliverables. It has nothing to do with the &amp;quot; exploded view&amp;quot; work, it&amp;rsquo;s just an exploration of the possibilities ahead of us, after design system is stable enough.
  Consistent Sandbox Access: Provide a consistent, accessible sandbox link for non-developers across the company. Treat Text Content as Components: Manage object names, button labels, and descriptions as components to ensure consistency.</description>

Fernanda will help me to install a local version, and we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss here audience, template, etc) component subscription (the code level of alignment, where products simply subscribe to a component version instead of building it themselves.</description>
